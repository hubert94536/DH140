## Potential project ideas

### Income inequality
https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/01/09/trends-in-income-and-wealth-inequality/
- This article interests me because it shows the trends in income inequality over the last few decades, which provides insight into whether the gap is converging.

- I would like to make this data visualization in Python because it clearly shows the difference in trend of income inequality between the United States and Europe.

### Other potential project topics
- Income inequality
- Social media effects on mental health
- Covid-19 effects on society
