# DH140 Final Project

## Topic: Billionaires

For my project, I will be analyzing information on billionaires worldwide. The dataset I will be using is from the CorGIS Dataset Project, and contains information on over 2,000 billionaires from various countries, along with details about their source of wealth, net worth, and industry.

My motivation for this project is to gain a deeper understanding of how wealth is distributed globally, and to explore the factors that contribute to the wealth of billionaires. Additionally, I am interested in examining patterns and trends in data on billionaires to identify commonalities and differences between billionaires from different demographics. Using this information, I can showcase the factors that are more likely to lead towards financial success and ways to make the distribution of wealth more equitable.

There are several questions I aim to answer in this project:

- What are the top industries that billionaires are involved in, and how has this changed over time?
- How does the net worth of billionaires vary by industry, country, and gender?
- Are there any notable patterns or trends in the data that can help explain the distribution of wealth among billionaires?

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook for which all analysis was done as well as a requirements.txt file to install the necessary packages.
